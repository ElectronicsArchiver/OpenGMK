# Cargo doesn't support different binaries targeting different architectures in one build,
# so dll-bridge must be built separately.
# If you're making 32-bit builds of the emulator as well, you may find it useful to put dll-bridge in the members list
# when you're building it. Make sure to remove it when making 64-bit builds though.
